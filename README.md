# ML-Loan-Predictions-Model
Explore machine learning models to predict borrower behavior in loan repayment scenarios. Utilizing historical data, assess the likelihood of loan default and enhance lending decisions with accurate predictive analytics.


# Workflow

*1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*
The first step involves exploring the dataset to gain insights into its structure, features, and distributions. EDA helps in understanding the characteristics of the data and identifying any patterns or trends that may be relevant for predictive modeling.

*2. Data Preprocessing*
Data preprocessing is performed to clean and prepare the dataset for modeling. This step may include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to ensure compatibility with machine learning algorithms.

*3. Model Training*
The next step is to train machine learning models using the preprocessed data. Various algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting, can be explored to build predictive models that capture the relationship between borrower attributes and loan repayment outcomes.

*4. Model Evaluation*
Once the models are trained, their performance is evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This step helps in assessing the effectiveness of the predictive models and identifying areas for improvement.
